\section{Typesetting Exercise \#1}
In March 2006, Congress raised that ceiling an additional \$0.79 trillion to \$8.97 trillion, which is approximately 68\% of GDP. As of October 4, 2008, the ``Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008" raised the current debt ceiling to \$11.3 trillion.

\section{Typesetting Exercise \#2}
Let $X_1$, $X_2$, ..., $X_n$ be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables with $E[X_i]=\mu$ and $Var[X_i]=\sigma^2<\infty$, and let
\begin{equation*}
    \centering
    S_n = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i
\end{equation*}
denote their mean. Then as $n$ approaches infinity, the random variables $\sqrt{n}(S_n-\mu)$ converge in distribution to a normal $N(0, \sigma^2).$
